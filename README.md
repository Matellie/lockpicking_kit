# Lockpicking Kit

You can find a set of various lockpicking tools that I designed on the CAD software Solidedge. But I do not guarantee their quality, since I m a total noob.

If you modelize other shapes of tools using the basis I propose, feel free to send a push request so that I can add them to the repo.


## Manufacturing

These tools can be easily manufactured with a laser cutting machine. However, the material used should not be too soft.


## Usage

Learn by yourself lol
